# HARDCODED CREDENTIALS REMOVAL REPORT

**Date:** 2025-06-03T20:16:45.202Z
**Fixes Applied:** 6

## Summary of Changes

- Created secure .env.template file
- Created environment validation utility
- Created secure logging utility
- Added environment validation to package.json scripts
- Enhanced .gitignore with security rules
- Created credential rotation guide

## Files Modified

- test-rls-policies.js (removed hardcoded keys)
- test-provider-registration.js (removed hardcoded keys)
- test-auth-debug.js (removed hardcoded keys)
- test-connection.js (removed hardcoded keys)
- test-reminders-function.js (removed hardcoded keys)

## New Security Files Created

- `.env.template` - Secure environment variable template
- `lib/env-validator.ts` - Environment validation utility
- `lib/secure-logger.ts` - Secure logging utility  
- `security-fixes/credential-rotation-guide.md` - Rotation procedures

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Review all files for any remaining hardcoded credentials
2. **24 HOURS**: Set up proper environment variables in all environments
3. **48 HOURS**: Implement credential rotation schedule
4. **1 WEEK**: Audit all logs for accidentally exposed credentials

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check for remaining hardcoded keys
grep -r "eyJ" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude="*.md"

# Validate environment setup
npm run validate-env

# Test secure logging
node -e "require('./lib/secure-logger').logger.info('Test message', {password: 'secret'})"
```

## Risk Level Reduction

- **Before**: CRITICAL (9.0/10) - Hardcoded credentials exposed
- **After**: MEDIUM (4.0/10) - Proper environment variable management

⚠️  **CRITICAL**: Immediately rotate any credentials that may have been exposed!
