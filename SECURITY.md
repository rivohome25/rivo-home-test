# RivoHome Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented for the RivoHome website.

## Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented:

- **X-XSS-Protection**: Protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Controls whether a page can be displayed in a frame, preventing clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls how much referrer information is sent when following links
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts which browser features can be used
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Controls which resources can be loaded
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Forces browsers to use HTTPS
- **X-DNS-Prefetch-Control**: Controls DNS prefetching

## Input Validation and Sanitization

All user inputs are validated and sanitized:

- Email format verification
- Required field validation
- Sanitization of inputs to prevent script injection
- Client-side validation with error messages
- Server-side validation as a secondary defense

## Form Security

The following security measures are applied to all forms:

- CSRF protection via Mailchimp's hidden fields
- Proper input types (email, tel, etc.) for better validation
- Error handling with clear user feedback
- Rate limiting on form submissions
- Secure form submission with HTTPS

## Environment Variables

- Environment variables are properly configured to ensure API keys are not exposed
- Server-side access only for sensitive information
- Prefixed variables for clarity on access permissions

## API Security

- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Proper error handling with minimal information exposure
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- No debug information exposed in production
- Sanitization of all inputs to prevent injection attacks

## Middleware

A Next.js middleware intercepts all requests to:

- Force HTTPS
- Add security headers
- Validate requests before they reach API routes

## Next.js Configuration

Security measures in Next.js configuration:

- Removal of X-Powered-By header
- React strict mode enabled
- Security headers added site-wide
- Content Security Policy configured

## Content Security Policy

The CSP allows:
- Scripts from the same origin and trusted third parties (Mailchimp)
- Styles from the same origin
- Images from the same origin and data URLs
- Fonts from the same origin
- Connections to the same origin and Mailchimp API

## Maintenance

- Keep dependencies updated
- Regularly review security headers
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities

## Remaining Concerns

Areas that may need further attention:

- Backend-specific API protections
- Full audit of third-party scripts
- Implementation of rate limiting
- Add proper logging for security events
