# Regional Task Lists Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines how to implement regional task lists for users based on their selected region and plan during onboarding. These tasks will be displayed in the user's dashboard after completing the onboarding process.

## Database Structure
The implementation relies on these database tables and views:
- `master_tasks`: Template maintenance tasks with region and plan filters
- `user_tasks`: User-specific maintenance tasks (cloned from master_tasks)
- `view_user_tasks`: View for fetching a user's tasks with proper formatting

## Client Implementation

### After Region Confirmation
Once the user confirms their region in the onboarding flow (Southeast in the example):

1. The region is stored in the `properties` table
2. The selected plan is stored in the `user_plans` table 
3. After clicking the final "Looks Good" button (completing step-5 of onboarding), call:

```javascript
await supabase.rpc('seed_user_tasks_for_current_user');
```

This RPC function will:
- Find all master_tasks matching the user's region and plan
- Create user_task entries for each matching task
- Link them to the user and their property

### Fetching Tasks in the Dashboard
To display the user's tasks in the UpcomingTasks component:

```javascript
const { data: tasks, error } = await supabase
  .from('view_user_tasks')
  .select('*');
```

This will return all 20 region+plan-tailored tasks for the current user.

## Task Filtering Logic
Tasks are filtered based on:
1. User's region (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, West, Northwest)
2. User's plan (Free, Core, Premium)

The `seed_user_tasks_for_current_user()` function handles this filtering automatically.

## User Flow
1. User selects region during onboarding
2. User selects plan during onboarding
3. User completes onboarding and clicks "Looks Good"
4. Client calls `seed_user_tasks_for_current_user()`
5. Tasks appear in the user's dashboard immediately

## Testing
To test this implementation:
1. Create a test user
2. Select different regions and plans during onboarding
3. Verify the correct regional tasks appear in the dashboard
4. Check that tasks are properly filtered based on the user's plan level
